# Containers Image Factory

A simple **Containers Image Factory**, meant to provision and build lightweight, secured **OCI** container images.

## Synopsis

The project, at the current stage, is a moving concept; it still lacks structure and automation. Experimenting with goals and features may lead to change the shape of the code and the tech stack (yet undefined) of the whole project, or parts of it.

The idea is to chain the provision of images, providing a solid core shared amongst the containers relying on the same base image.
